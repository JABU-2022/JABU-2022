## Projects and Experience

### Credit Card Fraud Detection App
Developed a web application that predicts the legitimacy of transactions using a machine learning model trained on features like time, glucose level, V1-V28, and amount. Enhanced fraud detection accuracy to protect customer information and financial transactions. [Link]

### Fashion Item Classifier
Implemented a classification system for fashion items using the Fashion-MNIST dataset and transfer learning techniques. Processed grayscale images into 10 categories, including T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers, converting them to RGB and resizing them to meet pre-trained model requirements. [Link]

### Jabu Clothing Brand E-commerce Platform
Created an online platform for Jabu Clothing Brand to facilitate seamless shopping experiences. Integrated browsing, purchasing, and secure transaction features to enhance user engagement and sales. [Link]

## Passion and Goals

I am meticulous with data, leveraging it to derive solutions that are beneficial across various areas. My current focus is on using AI in the fashion industry to mitigate environmental damage, though my interests are not limited to this sector. I am also committed to continuous learning, staying abreast of the latest advancements in AI. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of technology to make a significant impact on society.
